# Overview
DupAlerts, the Data Download Duplication Alert System (DDAS) is designed to optimize resource usage by preventing duplicate data downloads within an institutional environment. The system alerts users when they attempt to download a dataset that has already been downloaded on the system, thereby avoiding redundant downloads, saving bandwidth, and streamlining data management processes.

# Features
## IPFS Hashing for Duplicate Detection: 
  Uses IPFS hashing to uniquely identify files and detect duplicates, even if file names differ.
## Download Alerts: 
  Notifies users if a file they are downloading already exists on the system, providing the existing file's location and timestamp.
## Real-Time Data Management with Firebase: 
  Synchronizes dataset downloaded by any user, ensuring up-to-date information and alerts.
## Intuitive UI:
  Easy-to-navigate interface with search and filter functionality for efficient data access.

# Future Improvement Scope
## Local Download Alerts: 
  Warns users before downloading if the file has already been downloaded by them on their local system.
## Role-Based Access Control: 
  Only authorized users can approve downloads and delete files, enhancing security and data integrity.
## User Feedback Mechanism: 
  Allows users to report false positives and suggest improvements, contributing to the system's continuous refinement.


# Tech Stack
## React:
  Front-end framework for building the user interface.
## IPFS: 
  Decentralized storage system for content-addressable file storage.
## Firebase: 
  Real-time database and authentication services for seamless data management.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
